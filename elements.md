		<h4>Why Become a Sponsor</h4>

	</header>
	<p>
1) Our funding goes towards providing robotics classes, camps, workshops, & events to students of all backgrounds in Brookline. Robot parts are expensive! We also use our funds to buy wheels, U-channels, and more.
   <br>
   <br>
2) There are over 7,000 students in the Brookline Public Schools district, and we hope to reach all of them! With your help we can reach a larger group and make a bigger impact.
   <br>
   <br>
3) Robotics isn't cheap, but its impact on young students is invaluable. By funding the Brookline Robotics Initiative (BRI), you are providing students the joy of learning how to build & program a robot, work as a team, persevere, communicate effectively & confidently, be creative, think critically, and so much more. We hope you see the value of robotics just as we do.</p>

		<h2>2025 Fundraising</h2>
		<p>As a sponsor, you will help students in Brookline discover the applications of STEM and make learning fun! Your sponsorship  also allows us to gain resources and create new FLL and FTC teams in Brookline. We will use your financial resources for outreach purposes, to help sustain the multiple brookline teams, and most importantly to create meaningful qualifiers. By hosting qualifiers our team takes initiative, aiding the FTC and FLL communities and creating a space where all kids can enjoy and learn more about robotics. <p>
