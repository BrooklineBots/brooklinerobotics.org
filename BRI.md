<h3><b>What is the Brookline Robotics Initiative?</b></h3>
<p>
The Brookline Robotics Initiative is a 501(c)(3) non-profit dedicated to spreading robotics in Brookline and the Greater Boston Area through FIRST. We achieve this by hosting yearly events for FIRST. For example, we run qualifiers for the FIRST Tech Challenge, scrimmages for FLL Challenge teams, and FLL Explore Festivals. Additionally, the Brookline Robotics Initiative provide summer camps and classes to teach kids more about robotics and engage them in the STEM community!

<h3><b>What is the Brookline Robotics Initiative?</b></h3>
The Brookline Robotics Initiative (BRI) was founded in 2019 with the goal of promoting STEM education across Brookline through the excitement and innovation of the FIRST Robotics competition. What began as a small initiative by the BBots, a dedicated group of students, has since grown into a dynamic, community-driven movement that has inspired and engaged students in robotics, technology, and problem-solving.
In 2019, Brookline had only two FLL (FIRST LEGO League) teams and one FTC (FIRST Tech Challenge) team—the BBots themselves. Recognizing the potential of robotics to transform education, the BBots set out to expand the number of teams and create more opportunities for students to explore STEM. Their goal was to establish 40 FLL teams and 4 FTC teams across Brookline, while engaging 600 elementary and high school students in robotics. To make this happen, they organized a variety of outreach events, including FLL Explore Festivals, FLL Challenge scrimmages, FTC qualifiers, summer camps, and many other activities. They also envisioned a permanent robotics presence at Brookline High School (BHS), complete with a dedicated practice space and long-term coaching support.
Today, the BRI has made tremendous progress toward its original goals. Brookline now boasts 30+ FLL teams, and thanks to the addition of TNT and Cloud9, there are now three FTC teams at BHS. These teams have grown to include over 40 BHS students, surpassing the numbers of many traditional sports teams at the school—what an incredible accomplishment!
The BRI has engaged over 2,500 students in robotics, providing them with hands-on learning experiences and fostering a spirit of collaboration and innovation. The initiative has secured practice fields at the Brookline Teen Center and a temporary field at BHS, ensuring that students have access to the resources they need to develop their skills and create their robots.
This past year saw the formation of TNT, and the BBots and TNT teams worked together to further the BRI’s mission. Their collaboration helped both teams with the “Motivate” part of the competition, while also fostering outreach to the scientific community, supporting the “Connect” aspect. Through shared knowledge and support, the teams have worked together on robot challenges, strengthening their collaboration and teamwork.
Excitingly, we also learned that Cloud9, another Brookline team, was eager to join the BRI effort. With all three teams now working together, the BRI is creating a strong, collaborative, and sustainable robotics/STEM community in Brookline that will last for years to come.
To support these efforts, the BRI teams raise funds through several initiatives, with their summer camp being the largest fundraising event. In addition to participating in the camp, team members serve as counselors, earning $15+/hour—and for many, this is their first job! Last year, the teams raised approximately $11,000, which is reinvested into the program to fund team parts, registrations, and educational opportunities for the students.
The BRI also benefits from the guidance and support of an advisory board, which the teams meet with 2 times per year to receive advice and direction. The advisory board is always open to new members who are interested in supporting the mission and helping the BHS FTC teams continue to grow.
What began as a small group of motivated students—the BBots—has now become a powerful force for positive change in Brookline. The BRI continues to inspire students to compete, learn, collaborate, and have fun in the world of robotics, and we look forward to seeing what the next generation of innovators and problem-solvers will accomplish.
Please join us by starting an elementary school team or joining a high school team.  We look forward to growing robotics and STEM in Brookline together!​
